# Daily DSA Practice

My solutions for some DSA problems from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/), [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) etc.

Would be trying to solve and upload atleast one daily :)

**Find the solutions according to the difficulty level in their respective folders.**

## Contributions

I don't expect you to contribute to this repository, I made it for myself and myself alone. Still, if you are just too annoying to do it anyways, fork the repository, do your changes and submit a pull request. Depending on the quality of garbage you submit, I might consider to merge it :)

## Licensing

I don't give a shit to you copying these or smth. It is always better to write your own code. I advice you to use these as a reference and try to get the logic behind the problem instead of just copying the solutions and marking them as done. IDC, Just [do what the f*ck you want to](https://github.com/FireHead90544/daily-dsa-practice/blob/main/LICENSE), instead of eating my brain :)



Don't mind me, unable to touch my pc for the time being and not wanting to reset my commit steak either. What a cheap trick, forgive me lord GitHub ðŸ¥² :")
